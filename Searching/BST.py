# BST  better than other way of linear searching as it reduces computation aur isme ordering firse karne ki jarurat nahi
# it orders jis hisab se inputs aate rehte hai
# similar to divide and conqure
# Log of n time complexity

#traversals is like touching evey node or searching
# we dont know if sorted or not , like multiply every node by 2

# we dont store everything in list O(n) an hash map arent ordered 

# we use graph and trees that help us in traversals in O(log n)
